To play, drag ball back while keeping mouse down, let go of mouse to release. This will allow a sort of sling shot behaviour. You can also leverage the propeller at the bottom of the screen to increase the force at which you attack the tower. Eliminate all boxes from the tower before time runs out. Keys for game play are as below:
<br><br>
`r` = Reset the ball
<br>
`b` = New ball will drop from top of screen at location of mouse (on horizontal axis) 
<br>
`left arrow key` - Spin propeller clockwise 
<br>
`right arrow key` - Spin propeller counter-clockwise
